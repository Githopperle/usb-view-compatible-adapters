# USB-C Hub

A USB-C hub is recommended because the hub will allow you to connect to the following peripherals that will make for an ideal MixEffect user experience:

- **Power**: Being connected to power means the iPad will not run out of batteries during a long event.
- **Ethernet**: MixEffect's connection to an ATEM is best with a hardline Ethernet connection.
- **USB Ports**: Multiple USB ports means you can connect the HDMI to USB adapter, along with mice, keyboards, and other USB accessories.

Here are links to a recommended USB-C hub and cable combination:

- [USB C Hub, uni USB Type C 8 in 1 Hub with Detachable Connector, 4K HDMI, 1Gbps Ethernet, SD/MicroSD Card Reader, Up to 100W](https://amzn.to/4aZvBdp)
- [Monoprice USB Type-C to Type-C 3.1 Gen 2 Cable - 10Gbps, 5 Amp, 30AWG, 3.3 Feet](https://amzn.to/3y4eXLi)

What's good about the UNI hub is that it comes with a detachable cable, meaning it can be placed at comfortable distance away from the iPad.
